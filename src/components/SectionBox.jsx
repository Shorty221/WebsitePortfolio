      <p>
        Hi, My name is Prince Jabez L. Reyes and I'm a Computer Science student
        with cybersec specialization.<br></br>I mess around wifi devices usually
        on my home. I also do web programming(it's kinda obvious) and try to
        hack the website that I made.<br></br>
        Currently I'm studying how to get wifi password(educational ofc), the
        concept is, I disconnect the person connected to wifi and make a similar
        wifi name and when that person connects to wifi he/she will be
        redirected to a captive portal asking for the wifi password.{" "}
